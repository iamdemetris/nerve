**A transparent, local-first desktop coding harness with the focus of a small agent and the workflow of a complete workbench.**

Nerve keeps agent activity visible and gives you direct control over models, permissions, tools, approvals, Git, and background tasks while working with local projects.

> Nerve is beta software. It runs on Linux, Windows 11, and macOS and is distributed under the [Apache-2.0 license](LICENSE).

## Quick start

Nerve requires Node.js 24 or newer. Launch the latest published desktop app directly from npm:

```sh
npx @nervekit/desktop@latest
# or
pnpm dlx @nervekit/desktop@latest
```

The first launch may download Electron's platform binary. Nerve starts a local loopback daemon by default, and its application data stays under `~/.nerve`.

## Highlights

- Follow streaming messages, reasoning, tool calls, plans, approvals, questions, logs, and task output.
- Change the model, thinking level, agent mode, and permission policy without restarting a conversation.
- Work with conversations, files, Git changes, pull requests, project notes, and background tasks in one workbench.
- Configure providers, tools, global skills, and project resources from the UI.
- Keep projects and Nerve state local by default, with opt-in browser, LAN, mobile, and remote-daemon workflows.
